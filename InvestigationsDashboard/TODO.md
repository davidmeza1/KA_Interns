# TODO

## Documentation
* Add more explanation of what the app does
* Update Shiny dashboard rmarkdown file in `man` folder

## Functions to Add
* PCA
* Some Boxplots or pairs plots using ggplot2?

## Aesthetics
* Don't know how to specify size of DataTable so Feature Ranking page size is variable and (when no data) the footer appears higher than I'd like it to
